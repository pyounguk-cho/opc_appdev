## Scaling Down Nodes in a Java Cloud Service Instance Using the Command Line Interface ##

### Introduction ###
Upon deplying applications to JCS, you may need to scale your JCS instance in response to varying workload. You can scale an Oracle Java Cloud Service instance by scaling a cluster, a node, or the Coherence data tier in the service instance.

You can scale out an Oracle Java Cloud Service cluster to add one node to the cluster. When you scale out, Oracle Java Cloud Service creates a new VM running a WebLogic Server Managed Server instance.

You can also scale up or down a node to change the compute shape, memory, or block storage size, for more information about scaling an Oracle Java Cloud Service Instance. See the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/jcs_gs/JSCUG/GUID-02D79DE3-643B-44B9-A979-340BD472B529.htm#JSCUG3289). In this tutorial, you will go throuh steps to scale down using PSM CLI. Please note that it is also possible to perform the same task using JCS Console.

Oracle offers a PaaS Service Manager (PSM) Command Line Interface (CLI) that enables users of Oracle Application Container Cloud Service, Oracle Database Cloud Service, and Oracle Java Cloud Service to create, monitor and manage their service instances from a command shell or script.

For more information about PSM see the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/jcs_gs/jcs_cli.htm).

### Prerequisites ###

- Running Java Cloud Service with out-of-the-box [sample application](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/java-cloud/jscug/sample-application-deployed-oracle-java-cloud-service-instance.html) deployed
- which has 1 or more nodes with 2 or more OCPUs that may or may not be fronted by JCS Load Balancer
- [cURL command-line tool](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html). Usually cURL is already included in most of the Linux distributions and easy to install to Windows. You can use other tool to invoke REST API to download the latest version of the tool. (To install cURL is not scope of this documentation.)
- Python 3.3 or later. (To install Pyhton is not scope of this documentation.)

### Steps ###
#### Download the latest version of command line tool ####
You can download CLI package using cURL over REST. You can also download it from JCS console directly. We recommend the latter, but both methods are presented below.
First identify your REST API server name. If you log in to your Oracle cloud account with a US data center, use **psm.us.oraclecloud.com** otherwise, use **psm.europe.oraclecloud.com**.

Use cURL to send a request. The format is:

	curl -X GET -u username:password -H X-ID-TENANT-NAME:<identitydomain> https://<rest-server>/paas/core/api/v1.1/cli/<identitydomain>/client -o /u01/psmcli.zip

This will write the response to a file named `psmcli.zip`.

Open a terminal and execute the cURL command above with your credentials, identity domain identifier and REST API server name. REST 

	[oracle@localhost Desktop]$ curl -X GET -u john.i.smith@xxxxx.com:password -H X-ID-TENANT-NAME:hujohni https://psm.europe.oraclecloud.com/paas/core/api/v1.1/cli/hujohni/client -o /u01/psmcli.zip
	% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                   Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
	100 45968  100 45968    0     0  10993      0  0:00:04  0:00:04 --:--:-- 10999
	[oracle@localhost Desktop]$
Alternatively, you can access **Download Center** under **Help** menu in JCS Console, and download the PSM CLI zip file.

![](images/21.png)

Change to directory `/u01` and list directory to check the downloaded psmcli.zip file.

	[oracle@localhost Desktop]$ cd /u01
	[oracle@localhost u01]$ ls
	app  content  dpct  oepe-12.2.1.4.201608161938  psmcli.zip  python  wins

#### Installing the Command Line Interface ####

Install the PaaS CLI as a Python package.

Open a terminal, change to directory or make sure you are in directory `/u01` and use the PIP tool to install the CLI Python package.
	
	[oracle@localhost Desktop]$ cd /u01
	[oracle@localhost Desktop]$ sudo -H /u01/python/bin/pip3 install -U psmcli.zip

#### Configuring the Command Line Interface ####
Prior to running CLI commands, configure your connection to the Oracle cloud.

Open a terminal and run the `setup` command. When prompted, enter your cloud username, password, region, and identity domain. You may want to enter **json** for output format if you'd like to see details in the response. For example:

	[oracle@localhost u01]$ psm setup
	Username: john.i.smith@xxxxx.com
	Password: 
	Retype Password:

Leave this terminal open.

#### Monitor Scale-Down Operation on the Java Cloud Service Console ####
Navigate to the Oracle Java Cloud Service Console.[Sign in](../common/sign.in.to.oracle.cloud.md) to [https://cloud.oracle.com/sign-in](https://cloud.oracle.com/sign-in). On the dashboard open the Java Cloud Service Console.

![](images/00.png)

Click the service instance hosting sample application. If you have a JCS service instance with a different application that has been deployed successfully, you can continue the lab with that instance too. The deployed and running application here is used only to validate the scale-up or scale-down operation is successful.

![](images/01.png)

First, check whether the application is up and running by clicking the **Content Endpoint** url, which consists of the public IP address of your load balancer, if one is configured for the service, or the public address of one of the WLS node and root context of the application.

![](images/02.png)
![](images/03.png)

Come back to **JCS Service Instance Detail** page. Take the note of the number of OCPUs of the WLS node that you want to scale up in the **WLS/Resources** section under **Service Overview**. In this particular scenario, the selected node is currently consuming 2 OCPU.

![](images/04.png)

Go back to the terminal where psm was used and get the help of the scale-down command.

According to the help, give the necessary parameters to scale down the WLS node of your choice in the target JCS service instance. In the example below, please replace **SampleJCS** with your JCS instance name, and **SampleJC_server_1** with the name of the node which you want to scale down, and **oc3** with the shape you want to scale down to. **oc3** means you want to use one OCPU for that node.

	[oracle@localhost Desktop]$ psm jcs scale-down -s SampleJCS -n SampleJC_server_1 -p oc3
	{
    	"status":"New",
    	"details":{
        	"message":"scaleup.job.submitted$13958988$SampleJCS$SampleJC_server_1$oc3$",
        	"jobId":"13958988"
    	}
	}
	Job ID : 13958988
	[oracle@localhost Desktop]$ 

The response shows the Scaling Down Job has been submitted. You can get further information about the job using the provided jobId in the answer. Obviously if you have different service and/or managed server name then replace the parameters to reflect your environment properties.

Come back to JCS Service Console page by clicking **Oracle Java Cloud Service** in the breadcrum. You will notice that the service instance is now in the **Service Maintenance** status.

Click the **Services** tab at the top, and select the JCS service instance for which the scale-down operation was performed.  In the **Service Instance Details** page, you will notice that the number of OCPUs of the WLS node that you chose to scale down in the **WLS/Resources** section under **Service Overview** has changed accordingly. In this particular scenario, the selected node is now consuming 1 OCPU as per **oc3** parameter given in psm scale-down command above.
